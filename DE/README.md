Here are the Differential expression gene lists for HCC_AA and HCC-MK. Comparisons are made both pairwise or using one group versus the rest.
The cvs files contain list of all genes with p-value<0.05. 
The corresponding volcano plot shows the genes in the cvs file. Genes with the absolute value of log2foldchange > 1 are marked in red.
